## Code of Conduct

We, members of Chitter, pledge to keep our community safe and welcoming to others, regardless of their
age,
body size,
disability,
education,
ethnicity,
gender identity and expression,
language,
nationality,
religion,
sexual orientation,
skin colour,
and social and economic status. To that end, we must not engage, publicly nor privately, in abusive or antisocial behaviour such as:

* Hate speech or discrimination, including dogwhistling (implicit but deliberate discrimination through coded language)
* Posting others' personal information or private exchanges without permission
* Continuing to engage a person, or inciting others to do so, after they have expressely requested otherwise
* Other forms of harassment

We must not post content that is illegal in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, or France. This includes "grey area" content such as sexualised, artistic depictions of minors.

While we may post content that is sexual or sexually suggestive, it must be marked as sensitive and appropriately tagged with content warnings. Our profile pictures and banners are visible to all and must not be sexually suggestive at all.

Similarly, artistic depictions of graphic violence or gore must be tagged. Real pictures or recordings of such are not okay unless we've got a good reason to share them, such as education. Shock value is not a good reason.

Informational or entertaining bots are fine, but they may not post to the public timeline more than twice a day, and may not interact with members without some sort of prior acknowledgement or implicit opt-in from them (a follow, a mention, etc). This includes "followbots" and "federation bots."

When faced with behaviour that goes against this code, we may, in good faith, use the report feature. A staff member will then investigate and take fair and appropriate measures, to the best of their ability.

In doubt, we can refer to a member of staff, listed above, for guidance on what is or is not okay.

Users on remote servers interacting with Chitter members are held to the same standards, and will be silenced or suspended as appropriate.

Similarly, action will be taken against remote servers whose admins have repeatedly failed, or showed unwillingness, to deal with users that compromise the safety and wellness of our fellow members.

This code is not exhaustive. Staff members retain the right to take administrative action against a member, remote user, or remote server at any time and for any reason.

## Etiquette pointers

Many on the fediverse are trying to make social media kinder, more personal, and more accessible. Here are some things you can do to help.

* Use content warnings liberally.

  Commonly tagged subjects include:
    * Common phobias, and triggers (spiders, blood, gross stuff, trauma, etc)
    * Politics (often: "pol")
    * Hot takes (opinions delivered *on the spot* with little thought, often worded in a provocative and generalising manner)
    * Selfies
    * Public displays of affection, affectionate subtoots (often: "pda")
    * Food
    * Money
    * Family
    * Health
    * Mental health in particular (often: "mh")
    * Negativity
    * Negativity about oneself in particular (often: "self neg")

  Additionally, when a lot of people are talking about one subject, it's polite to tag that subject, using the CW as a *subject field* of sorts. It is also polite to tag long posts and threads similarly.

  Content warnings are invaluable in letting people decide if and when to deal with subjects that may be harmful or exhausting to them.

  It is helpful to augment a CW, indicating if it is positive (+), negative (-), a joke, a shitpost, etc. More context is always better.

* Strive for accessibility

  You can add a caption to images or videos you upload. This helps people with sight impairments get the context of your post. Writing a good, concise caption is an art but any caption is better than none!

  Another practice that helps is spelling hashtags composed of several words #LikeThis with capital letters, as opposed to #likethis. This helps screen-reader software read them correctly.

  It's also polite to CW posts that won't make any sense to screen-readers at all, like ASCII art or posts spelling out things in
  <span title="emoji" aria-label='emoji'>üí∂‚ìÇÔ∏èüÖæÔ∏èüå∂Ô∏è‚ùó</span>

* Avoid using a crossposter.

  These programs or services broadcast your posts from one network to another and back, usually between Twitter and a fediverse server like Chitter. They are controversial across the fediverse. A common criticism is that it feels like the person is "not really there," reacting to things happening on another network entirely, and broadcasting Twitter culture, which many have come to the fediverse to avoid.

  If you want to use one despite this, it is polite to set it not to post remote posts as public, and even to set a CW on them indicating where the posts originated.

It is up to each one of us whether we want to follow these guidelines, but administrative action may be taken against members behaving counter to them to the point of disturbing others, and continuing to do so after being asked to change their behaviour.
